Use notepad.au3 which has only very few of lines, just to understand how winWaitActive() function work.
Autoit do system call to use shellexecute to run notepad (see #684683), then it uses EnumWindows() 
to iterate over windows and use GetWindowText() to read the window title and compare it to the title 
provided in WinWaitActive(). See #757153

- I initintially added a sleep statement before and after WinWaitActive(), and indeed GetWIndoeText() 
call is hapenning between the two sleep statement
