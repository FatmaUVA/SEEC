1) plot-DUT-x-axis-loss-error-bar.py
for different apps, this script plot in the x-axis the packet loss rate, in the left y-axis DUT, and right Y-axis total bytes.
Each point is the mean of each run, and each run consist of multiple tasks (images) and the geo mean is computed for each each run.

2) plot-autoit-DUT.py
This script use autoit and DUT (display-updates-2) numbers to find: 
- the diff of the two numbers.
- computing transmision time
- processing time + retrans (the remaining time)
then plot all these times

Also, it uses marker-packets timer 

3) plot-marker-DUT-RT.py
This script create two plots to show DUT and marker packets:
i. x-axis: sec, Y-axis: packet size
ii. x-axis: ms, Y-axis: total KBytes computed every ms
ALso both plots have vertical lines indicate starts and end of DUT and marker RT

4) Web360-plot-DUT-x-axis-loss-error-bar.py
Specifically for Web360, plot one line for each task: drag and drop, zoom-in and zoom-out, where each run consist of visiting 3 images
